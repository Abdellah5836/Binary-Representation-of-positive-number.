# Binary-Representation-of-positive-number.
What if we want to print the binary representation of a positive number. In order to do so, we can use a simple algorithm that divides by 2 until we reach 0 and collects the remainders. When we reverse the list of remainders we collected, we get the binary representation of the Number we started with.
